# VSOFI: virtual modulation based high-throughput fluorescence fluctuation super-resolution imaging  

This repository contains the MATLAB code for VSOFI, a super-resolution imaging technique based on virtual modulation of fluorescence fluctuation data.  


## Quick Start  

### 1. Download Data  
Download the **fluorescence fluctuation data** from the [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30446918.v2](img.zip), and place the downloaded data files into the `./img/` directory.  


### 2. Run Reconstruction  
Execute the main script `VSOFI_main.m` in MATLAB to generate the super-resolution imaging result.
